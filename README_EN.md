### 🙋‍♂️ About me

I am a **Programming Student** from Portugal 🇵🇹, passionate about technology. As I deepen my knowledge and experience, I am focused on advancing in **Back-End** technologies and **Desktop Application Development**.

My main area of focus and passion is the **C++** language, which I explore to create projects that challenge me in terms of architecture and performance. Additionally, I have foundational knowledge in **Javascript** and **PHP**, and I am always exploring new technologies and programming paradigms.

I am actively seeking an opportunity to apply and develop my skills by contributing to challenging software development projects.

In my free time, I enjoy watching movies 🎬, listening to music 🎧, taking nature walks 🌳, spending time with close friends ☕, and **exploring simple reverse engineering scenarios for sheer appreciation of the field** ⚙️.

### 🔭 I'm currently working on

I am currently developing a [CHIP-8 Emulator](https://github.com/joaomiguelcurto/chip8-emulator). This project allows me to deepen my knowledge of architecture, low-level C++, and optimization.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning

* **Design Patterns**: Trying to utilize more design formats to write more robust and scalable code.
* **Databases (SQL)**: Developing my knowledge of manipulating and querying relational databases.
* **Front-end Fundamentals**: Gaining basic Front-end knowledge, not to be an expert, but to have a more complete view of application development.
